## I worked on <br>
### Cloud Computing Project<br>
Created a file-sharing system by Django Framework and hosted it on AWS. We had written client/server-side for file transfer in python (Socket Programming) and integrated it into the website with Django. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript for the frontend and making the website dynamic.

### I contributed to OpenSource this summer<br>
I ported a given set of Libraries and convert their logic and implement them into working Libraries supporting App Development in HarmonyOS  and contributing them to the Application Library Group.
